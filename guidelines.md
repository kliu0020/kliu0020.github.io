# Context Engineering Reference — Luxury Liquor Storefront

This file defines the **non-negotiable context** for extending an existing Lovable-generated
luxury liquor **storefront**.  
Use this as grounding input for Cursor or any code-editing agent.

---

## 1. Project State (Ground Truth)

- Codebase generated by **Lovable**
- Homepage already exists and is the **visual + structural reference**
- Objective: **extend into a full storefront**, not redesign

**Never**
- Re-theme the site
- Change the homepage layout, colors, or typography
- Introduce a new design system

---

## 2. Storefront Positioning

- Premium / high-end liquor retailer
- Commercial intent: **sell alcohol**
- Luxury, restrained, confident
- Speakeasy tone, but **transactional**
- Curation-led commerce (not bulk retail)

This is:
- A store, not a gallery  
- A catalogue with intent, not a marketplace  

---

## 3. Aesthetic Constraints (Hard Rules)

- Dark / near-black backgrounds
- Muted gold or neutral accents only
- Minimalist composition
- Editorial spacing

**Disallowed**
- Bright colors
- Sales banners
- Countdown timers
- Discount badges
- Popups
- Playful UI
- Loud animations

Luxury ≠ silence, but luxury ≠ noise.

---

## 4. Commerce Philosophy

- Fewer SKUs, higher perceived value
- One bottle per product page
- Slow browsing encouraged
- Scarcity framing allowed
- Price is visible but not emphasised

Avoid:
- Grid spam
- “Add to cart” dominance
- Upsell / cross-sell clutter

---

## 5. Typography & Copy Tone

### Typography
- Serif headings (editorial, confident)
- Clean sans-serif body
- Large headings
- Generous spacing

### Copy
- Short sentences
- Neutral, confident tone
- No hype language
- No “Buy now” energy
- Product descriptions feel like library cards, not ads

---

## 6. Required Storefront Pages

These pages are expected in a serious liquor store.

### Core
- `/collections` — category-led browsing
- `/product/[slug]` — single-product focus
- `/cart` — minimal, distraction-free
- `/checkout` — compliant, clear, restrained

### Support
- `/about` — brand + curation philosophy
- `/journal` — editorial content (optional SEO)
- `/contact` — support, appointments, trade
- `/legal` — licensing, responsible service, terms

---

## 7. UX Rules for Selling Alcohol

- Age gating if not already present
- Responsible service language in footer
- Clear shipping restrictions by region
- No encouragement of overconsumption
- No gamification

---

## 8. Engineering Constraints

- Reuse existing layout, components, tokens
- Extend routing, don’t refactor core
- No new visual primitives
- Production-ready code only
- No placeholders

Prefer **clarity over cleverness**.

---

## 9. Cursor Prompting Guidance

When prompting Cursor:
- Use: **“extend the storefront”**
- Specify: **“reuse existing homepage styles”**
- State: **“do not redesign or restyle”**
- Ask for: **clean, minimal commerce flows**

Cursor should behave like a senior engineer
adding commerce pages to a live luxury store.

---

## 10. Success Criteria

Success looks like:
- Products feel expensive before price is seen
- Checkout feels calm, not urgent
- Browsing feels intentional, not endless
- The store sells without shouting

Failure looks like:
- Cheap e-commerce tropes
- Visual noise
- Feature bloat
- “Startup SaaS” energy

---

## 11. Mental Model

This is a **luxury storefront**.

The goal is not to maximise clicks.
The goal is to make purchase feel inevitable.
